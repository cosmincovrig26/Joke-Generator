For the application to work you must have installed:
XAMPP

1. Open XAMPP and run MySQL and Apache Server
2. Navigate to 'localhost/phpmyadmin/'
3. Create mysql database 'fathom03task1'
4. Copy everything from sqlscript in source_files and use it to create the table 'jokes'
4. Run importjson.php to import modified index.json file to database 
5. Run index.php in source_files to try application

For the task I decided to use PHP, HTML/CSS/JS. This is because its a robust language for small
web applications and I have the most experience using it for server side scripting. 
No libraries were used, all of the code was pure.
